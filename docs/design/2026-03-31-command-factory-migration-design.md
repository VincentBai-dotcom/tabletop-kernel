# Command Factory Migration Design

## Goal

Move consumer command authoring from class-based `implements CommandDefinition`
to a `defineCommand(...)` / `createCommandFactory(...)` API.

The engine, not the consumer, should provide the method input types for:

- `isAvailable(context)`
- `discover(context)`
- `validate(context)`
- `execute(context)`

## Problem

Current command authoring makes consumers define too much type plumbing.

In Splendor today, the consumer has to:

- define local context aliases in
  [`examples/splendor/src/commands/shared.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/examples/splendor/src/commands/shared.ts)
- manually annotate the parameter type of `isAvailable`, `discover`,
  `validate`, and `execute`
- repeat the game-state type in each command class generic

This happens because `class ... implements CommandDefinition<...>` only checks
compatibility after the class is written. It does not contextually type class
method parameters from the interface.

## Recommended Direction

Adopt a game-bound command factory as the primary authoring API.

Recommended shape:

```ts
const defineSplendorCommand = createCommandFactory<SplendorGameState>();

export const takeThreeDistinctGemsCommand = defineSplendorCommand({
  commandId: "take_three_distinct_gems",
  payloadSchema: t.object({
    colors: t.optional(t.array(t.string())),
    returnTokens: t.optional(t.record(t.string(), t.number())),
  }),
  discoveryDraftSchema: t.object({
    selectedColors: t.optional(t.array(t.string())),
    returnTokens: t.optional(t.record(t.string(), t.number())),
  }),

  isAvailable({ game, actorId, runtime }) {
    return true;
  },

  discover({ game, actorId, discoveryInput }) {
    return {
      complete: true,
      payload: {
        colors: [],
      },
    };
  },

  validate({ game, runtime, commandInput }) {
    return { ok: true };
  },

  execute({ game, commandInput, emitEvent }) {
    void emitEvent;
  },
});
```

In that model:

- `SplendorGameState` is bound once in the factory
- payload type is inferred from `payloadSchema`
- draft type is inferred from `discoveryDraftSchema`
- method parameter types are supplied by the engine
- consumers no longer need local context aliases

## Why `defineCommand(...)` Instead Of A Base Class

An abstract base class would improve the current class API, but it would still
be weaker than a factory:

- it can reduce explicit method parameter annotations
- but it still requires class generics
- and it still cannot infer `TPayload` / `TDraft` from sibling schema
  properties in the same way an object-literal factory can

The factory approach is the closest match to the desired Elysia-style
experience.

## Proposed API Shape

### Public Factory

Add:

```ts
createCommandFactory<FacadeGameState>();
```

It returns:

```ts
defineCommand(config);
```

### Discoverable vs Non-Discoverable Commands

The `defineCommand(...)` input should be a discriminated union at the type
level:

- non-discoverable commands:
  - no `discover`
  - no `discoveryDraftSchema`
- discoverable commands:
  - `discover` required
  - `discoveryDraftSchema` required

This preserves the protocol guarantees already enforced in
[`packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/describe.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/describe.ts),
but moves the rule earlier into the authoring surface.

### Return Shape

`defineCommand(...)` should return the same structural command object shape the
engine already uses today:

- `commandId`
- `payloadSchema`
- optional `discoveryDraftSchema`
- optional `isAvailable`
- optional `discover`
- required `validate`
- required `execute`

This keeps the migration mostly at the authoring and typing layer.

## Dependency Surface Investigation

### 1. GameDefinitionBuilder

File:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/src/game-definition.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/game-definition.ts)

Current behavior:

- accepts a command map or a command list
- normalizes list input into a command map by `commandId`

Conclusion:

- this area does not require a structural redesign
- the builder already depends on command object shape, not command classes
- only typing cleanup may be needed

### 2. GameExecutor Runtime

File:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/src/runtime/game-executor.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/runtime/game-executor.ts)

Current behavior:

- reads command objects from `game.commands`
- calls `isAvailable`, `discover`, `validate`, and `execute`
- hydrates facade state on demand before each command lifecycle call

Conclusion:

- no migration issue here, as long as `defineCommand(...)` returns the same
  object contract
- facade hydration should continue to work unchanged

### 3. Protocol Descriptor

File:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/describe.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/describe.ts)

Current behavior:

- reads `payloadSchema`
- reads `discoveryDraftSchema`
- validates discoverability pairing

Conclusion:

- no class dependency
- should continue to work if the returned command object has the same fields

### 4. AsyncAPI Generator

File:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/asyncapi.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/protocol/asyncapi.ts)

Current behavior:

- builds submit-command schemas from `payloadSchema`
- builds discovery input/result/rejection schemas from
  `discoveryDraftSchema` and `payloadSchema`

Conclusion:

- no class dependency
- should continue to work unchanged if command objects retain the same
  properties

### 5. Example Games

Files:

- [`examples/splendor/src/commands`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/examples/splendor/src/commands)

Current behavior:

- every command is a class
- local context aliases exist only to work around the class typing problem

Required changes:

- replace classes with `defineSplendorCommand(...)`
- remove most or all of the command-context aliases from
  [`examples/splendor/src/commands/shared.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/examples/splendor/src/commands/shared.ts)
- keep helper functions like `assertAvailableActor`, `readPayload`, and
  `readDraft`

### 6. Tests

Files:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/tests`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/tests)
- [`examples/splendor/tests`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/examples/splendor/tests)

Required changes:

- command fixtures in tests should move from classes to factory-defined command
  objects where they are testing normal consumer authoring
- internal engine typing tests should be updated to validate the new factory
  inference behavior explicitly

### 7. Exports and Public API Surface

File:

- [`packages/tabletop-engine/src/index.ts`](/home/vincent-bai/Documents/github/tabletop-kernel/packages/tabletop-engine/src/index.ts)

Required changes:

- export `createCommandFactory`
- likely keep `CommandDefinition` as the structural type the factory returns

Open question:

- whether to keep the class-oriented authoring path officially supported or
  treat it as legacy-only

## What Probably Does Not Need To Change

These areas appear structurally compatible with the migration:

- command storage in `GameDefinition`
- command execution in `GameExecutor`
- facade hydration during availability/discovery/validation/execution
- protocol descriptor extraction
- AsyncAPI generation

The main migration is at the authoring API and type inference boundary, not the
execution pipeline.

## Awkward Or Risky Areas

### 1. Keeping Class Authoring As A First-Class API

If class authoring remains equally blessed:

- consumers will still see two competing ways to write commands
- the worse DX path remains visible in docs/examples
- the engine will need to explain why one path infers well and the other does
  not

Recommendation:

- make `defineCommand(...)` the primary API
- treat class-based command authoring as legacy compatibility if kept at all

### 2. Full Backward Compatibility In Types

Trying to preserve every current generic pattern while also introducing the new
factory may make the type surface noisier than necessary.

Recommendation:

- preserve structural runtime compatibility
- do not over-optimize for every old class-based typing pattern

### 3. Game-Bound Factory Requirement

The best DX comes from:

```ts
const defineSplendorCommand = createCommandFactory<SplendorGameState>();
```

This means the consumer still binds the game state once per game package.

That is acceptable, but it is still one explicit step. There is no realistic
way to remove even that while keeping the command definitions decoupled from the
builder.

## Migration Recommendation

Recommended sequence:

1. add `createCommandFactory<FacadeGameState>()`
2. keep `CommandDefinition` as the structural return type
3. add type tests proving contextual inference for all four methods
4. migrate Splendor commands first
5. remove local Splendor command-context aliases
6. update docs/examples to present factory-based authoring as the default
7. decide later whether to de-emphasize or remove class-style authoring

## Summary

The key finding is:

- the executor, builder, protocol descriptor, and AsyncAPI generator already
  depend on command shape, not command class identity

That means the migration is viable and mostly localized.

The main work is:

- introduce a game-bound command factory
- migrate examples/tests
- simplify the public authoring story

The main thing to avoid is trying to preserve class-based authoring as an equal
first-class experience, because that keeps the exact DX problem this migration
is meant to solve.
